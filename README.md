# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

Fairly messy and potentially suboptimal solutions to [AOC22](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

* `solutions` contains the raw python solutions used to get on the leaderboard
    - these solutions exercise no restraint in package/module usage
    - commits use tag `raw`
* `python` contains slightly more civilized and cleaned-up python solutions
    - input file is specified on last line
* `rust` contains rust solutions (experimental)
* `inputs` contains problem inputs (as generated for me)

> tested on Python 3.10.6
